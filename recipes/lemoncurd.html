    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    <li>150g caster (superfine) sugar</li>
    <li>Â½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
    <li>115g unsalted butter, cubed and cold</li></li>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <li>
    <li>Beat together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, zest and juice. Pour into a small saucepan and stir over low-medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
    <li>Add the cold butter a couple of pieces at a time, stirring until each addition is melted and incorporated. Make sure not to let the curd come to a bubble at any time.</li>
    <li>Continue cooking the mixture another few minutes until it is thickened and coats the back of a spoon or leaves a thick coating on the side of the pan when you tilt it.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl to remove any bits of egg that may not have mixed through.</li>
    <li>Pour into sterilised conserve jars and cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Seal the jars and store in the fridge. </li></li>
