    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>2 large eggs</ul>
    <ul>2 egg yolks</ul>
    <ul>150 g caster (superfine) sugar</ul>
    <ul>Â½ cup fresh lemon juice</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon lemon zest</ul>
    <ul>115 g unsalted butter, cubed and cold</ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>Beat together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, zest and juice. Pour into a small saucepan and stir over low-medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.</ol>
    <ol>Add the cold butter a couple of pieces at a time, stirring until each addition is melted and incorporated. Make sure not to let the curd come to a bubble at any time.</ol>
    <ol>Continue cooking the mixture another few minutes until it is thickened and coats the back of a spoon or leaves a thick coating on the side of the pan when you tilt it.</ol>
    <ol>Pour the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean bowl to remove any bits of egg that may not have mixed through.</ol>
    <ol>Pour into sterilised conserve jars and cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Seal the jars and store in the fridge. </ol>
